## Features implemented ##

* 	4 Band resistor visualization.
*	Function buttons to set colour and value of each band respectively. 
*   Tolerance buttons to configure tolerance level of 4th band.
* 	Calculate function to compute resitance value of the resistor based on the bands' colors. 
* 	Tolerance display feature where both percentage and value in Ohms is shown next to the main resistance value. 
* 	Reset button to clear all values and colours set in the app. 

## To Use: ##

* 	Open in Android Studio.
* 	Build and send to phone. 
* 	In app,
	** Tap a band of your choice the resistor. 
	** Choose a colour for the band you want. 
	** Continue for bands 1-3.
	** Select band 4 and choose either gold or silver for the tolerance value. 
	** Tap Calculate button to view the resistance and tolerance value of the resistor.
	** Tap reset button to clear the result and the bands before calculating another value.
