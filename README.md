## Features implemented ##

features implemented: 
* 	4 Band resistor visualization.
*	Function buttons to set colour and value of each band respectively. 
*   Tolerance buttons to configure tolerance level of 4th band.
* 	Calculate function to compute resitance value of the resistor based on the bands' colors. 
* 	Tolerance display feature where both percentage and value in Ohms is shown next to the main resistance value. 
* 	Reset button to clear all values and colours set in the app.
